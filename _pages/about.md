# About Me

I am a first-year Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Cunxi Yu. My research interests include Logic Synthesis, Formal Verification, and AI/LLM for EDA. I welcome collaboration on any research projects in these areas - feel free to contact me at zhansong@umd.edu if you're interested in working together.

You can find my CV [here](/files/cv.pdf).
